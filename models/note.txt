In the context of Node.js and Express, MVC is often implemented using a combination of middleware and routing. The model is responsible for managing data and business logic, the view is responsible for presenting data to the user, and the controller is responsible for handling user requests, updating the model, and rendering the appropriate view.

Here is a breakdown of how MVC can be implemented in Node.js and Express:

Model: In Node.js, the model can be implemented as a module or object that interacts with the database or other data sources. This module can define functions to create, read, update, and delete data.

View: The view can be implemented using template engines like Pug, Handlebars, or EJS. Views are responsible for rendering HTML and displaying data to the user.

Controller: In Express, controllers can be implemented as middleware functions that handle requests from the client. The controller can access the model to retrieve or update data and render the appropriate view.

By following the MVC design pattern, developers can create a more organized and scalable codebase that is easier to maintain and update over time.
